# Description

We have caught all the play_by_play happening during a NBA game so we have a flow of data and we want to create a nice array of hash which will sum everything.

Part I
Create a function analyse_nba_game(play_by_play_moves) which receives an array of play and will return a dictionary summary of the game.

Each play follow this format:

PERIOD|REMAINING_SEC|RELEVANT_TEAM|AWAY_TEAM|HOME_TEAM|AWAY_SCORE|HOME_SCORE|DESCRIPTION
They are ordered by time.

The return dictionary (hash) will have this format:

{"home_team": {"name": TEAM_NAME, "players_data": DATA}, "away_team": {"name": TEAM_NAME, "players_data": DATA}}
DATA will be an array of hashes with this format:
{"player_name": XXX, "FG": XXX, "FGA": XXX, "FG%": XXX, "3P": XXX, "3PA": XXX, "3P%": XXX, "FT": XXX, "FTA": XXX, "FT%": XXX, "ORB": XXX, "DRB": XXX, "TRB": XXX, "AST": XXX, "STL": XXX, "BLK": XXX, "TOV": XXX, "PF": XXX, "PTS": XXX}
